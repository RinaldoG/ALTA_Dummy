    title: NLP for Healthcare in the Absence of a Healthcare Dataset
    abstract: "Epidemic intelligence deals with the detection of outbreaks using formal (such as hospital records) and informal (such as user-generated text on the web) sources of information. However, official records may not always be available for healthcare research. In this tutorial, we discuss approaches for epidemic intelligence that use unofficial and open datasets. We view past work in terms of two broad categories: health mention classification (selecting relevant text from a large volume) and health event detection (predicting epidemic events from a collection of relevant text). The focus of our discussion is the underlying computational linguistic techniques in the two categories. We also discuss the state-of-the-art in annotation techniques, resources and evaluation strategies when applying NLP for healthcare."
