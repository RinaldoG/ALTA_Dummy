    ALTA 2019 Sponsors and more sponsorship opportunities
  title: Sponsoring ALTA 2019
---
ALTA is extremely grateful to these organisations for financially supporting ALTA. There are still more sponsorship opportunities available for the ALTA 2019 Workshop. Sponsorship provides exposure of an organisation’s product or services to the leading Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval academics, industry researchers and students in the Australasian region and beyond. This sponsorship helps us keep registration fees to a minimum to encourage broad participation, and provide travel support for student attendees.

ALTA is the premier professional organisation for language technology in Australasia, with a membership of more than 200 researchers and professionals. ALTA 2019 is the 17th workshop in the current format, and will include keynotes from internationally recognised experts plus tutorials.

If you represent an organisation which may be willing to provide sponsorship, we have a number of sponsorship packages available to suit a wide range of budgets – please [contact us](mailto:workshop@alta.asn.au) to find out more.
