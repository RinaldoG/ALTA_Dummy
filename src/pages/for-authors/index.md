## Camera-Ready Versions

All authors have now been notified whether their paper has been accepted. Congratulations to authors of accepted papers. Camera-ready versions are due by the 15th of November, and should be re-submitted via EasyChair. To accomodate suggestions from reviewers, up to one extra page can be added to the main content of the paper, so short papers may be up to 5 pages and long papers may be up to 9 (excluding references). Apart from addressing reviewer comments, please remember to add author names back in.

## Presentations

All accepted papers will present both an oral and a poster presentation. Long paper presentation will be 10 minutes + 3 minutes QA, and short paper presentations will be 8 minutes + 2 minutes QA. Oral presentations are expected to be live, however, in exceptional circumstances, we accept a recorded video if the authors can not present live (please communicate with the organisers, and share your video link with them if you can not present live).

## Posters

In addition to the live presentations, all papers should submit their poster as a PDF file named with paper number (e.g. 22.pdf) to william@alta.asn.au. The posters will be installed at
the social gathering platform.
