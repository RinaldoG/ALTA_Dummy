## Camera-Ready Versions

All authors have now been notified whether their paper has been accepted. Congratulations to authors of accepted papers. Camera-ready versions are due by the 15th of November, and should be re-submitted via EasyChair. To accomodate suggestions from reviewers, up to one extra page can be added to the main content of the paper, so short papers may be up to 5 pages and long papers may be up to 9 (excluding references). Apart from addressing reviewer comments, please remember to add author names back in.

## Presentations

If your acceptance notification says that you have a presentation, you will be given a presentation slot. Long paper presentations will be 10 minutes + 3 minutes QA, and Short Paper presentations will be 8 minutes + 3 minutes QA. Presenters can use their own laptops or the provided machine in the conference venue.

## Posters

If you have been notified that your paper has been accepted as a poster, you are required to provide a poster in PDF format (size A0).
