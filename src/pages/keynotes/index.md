    bio: "Mark Johnson is Chief AI Scientist, Oracle Digital Assistant at Oracle Corporation, and a Professor of Language Sciences in the Department of Computing, Macquarie University.  He’s also an Editor in Chief for the Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.  Mark has worked on a wide range of topics in computational linguistics, but his main area of research is natural language understanding, especially syntactic parsing and semantic analysis, and their applications to text and speech processing."
    affiliation: "Oracle; Macquarie University"
    title: Building new kinds of Natural Language Understanding and Conversational AI with Deep Learning
    abstract: "Deep learning provides new fundamental tools, such as contextualised word embeddings and seq2seq models, that let us build new kinds of Natural Language Understanding apps faster, better and cheaper than ever before.  The advanced pattern-matching capabilities of deep learning enable a new approach to app development where the system's behaviour is learnt from training data, dramatically reducing the need for manual scripting.  This talk describes how we are using this technology in the Oracle Digital Assistant, focusing especially on Conversational AI.  The talk ends with a discussion of how research advances in areas such as explainability, few-shot learning, data augmentation and transfer learning can help this technology achieve its full potential."

The ALTA Workshop is the premier venue in Australia, New Zealand and the surrounding region for sharing research in Natural Language Processing and Computational Lingustics. Submissions from students, academics and industry researchers are welcome. The workshop is run annually, usually in December, under the auspices of the [Australasian Language Technology Association](https://www.alta.asn.au).

ALTA 2019 will be held at University of Technology Sydney from the 4th to the 6th of December. The [call for papers](/call-for-papers) is now available.
