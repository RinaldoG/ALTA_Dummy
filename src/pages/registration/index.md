## Registration Site

* Resgister TBA soon

Registration is AUD75 for standard registration and free for students, thanks to the generosity of our sponsors. If you believe you are entitled to a free registration due to your organisation being a sponsor, please [contact us](mailto:workshop@alta.asn.au).

## Inclusions

Registration includes daytime catering (morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea) for the two days of the main conference, as well as the conference dinner on the evening of the 14th of January 2021 (due to capacity constraints, this may not be available for late registrations).
